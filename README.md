# Introduction
What is this language design for? 

GoLang was developed to improve networking/infustructure and distributed systems overall. 

What i'll be going over ... 
1. History
2. Features
3. Advantages/Disadvantages
4. Applications of the language
5. Demonstration
6. Questions/Conclusion

## History and background

1. Where did it come from?
	* It was designed at google in 2007

2. Who developed it and why?
	* Robert Griesmier, Rob Pike, Ken Thomposon
		- Dennis richie (creator of C) worked with Ken Thompson
		- All work at bell labs on Go
		- Google engineers started work on microservices so large latency started to increase. Engineers wanted a language that could handle distributed transactions, RPC etc with low latency and concurrency. 


# Language Features

1. What are it's salient features? 
	* The biggest feature of golang is "Concurrency". Golang has special language pardigms for concurrent programming
	* Static typing and runtime efficiency of C++
	* Object oriented programmin
	* Concurrency  

**Concurrency**: Concurrency is when your program is built in a way where multiple things "may" happen. 

**Parallelism**: Two things happening at the same time. 




2. What can this language do that others can't? 

We live concurrent lives (not paralelle). Everyday when we get up, we execute tasks that happen in the background that take a certain amount of time. 
	* Start timer for cofee pot
	* Turn computer on
	* Process data

Golang shines in microservice devlopment
**Microservice**: Smaller web/networked application that is implemented in a largely distributed system

Other languages that are popularly used for the same purposes
	* Node Js (Bad package management)
	* PHP (Commonly vunerable to sql injections)
	* Python (slow)
	* C/C++ (larger code base, more complex, memory etc) 
	* Java ( System.out.println("Hello")



# Advantages and Disadvantages

1. Why use this language?
	* web servers/http/grpc
	* black hat hacking
	* writting malware
	* forwarding backend meter reports for a tier rate water calculator


2. Why not? 

1. Game Development (C/C++)
2. Mobile app development (Not too many libraries out yet)

# Applications

1. What kinds of applications are good for this language? BlockChains, Concurrent Web Servers etc 

**Some things i;ve see

# Sample Programs

1. What is the language designed for
2. What applications fir that language best? 
3. What are the salient points of the language? 


# Conclusions
1. What is in store for this technolology
2. Why might it suceed
3. Why might it fail?
4. What whould we remember/know about the language?
